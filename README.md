# Reply Token â€“ An ERC-721 compliant Ethereum NFT
A smart contract for an NFT token that implements the ERC721 standard.

Final project for course "Blockchain" during my 2nd Level Specializing Master's Programme at Polytechnic University of Turin.

## Description
The smart contract allows to mint new Reply Tokens and transfer them in exchange of a specific amount of Reply Coins. The token's value can be customized upon creation.

The Reply Token has a value in [Reply Coins](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x85f2c7d5ff473ed5582d105a6253d24e382b6803) and in order to be transferred the equal amount of Reply Coins must be exchanged. As a consequence, since Reply Coins can be obtained only by students registered to the [Students Registry](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x130e2c13cf39cbe647bc0f7d8dabb499f5e6364d#code), only a Reply Student can buy the token.

## Deployment
The smart contract was deployed on the Ropsten testnet and is available [here](
